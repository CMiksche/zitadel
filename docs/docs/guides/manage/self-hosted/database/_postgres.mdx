:::caution
Postgres extension is currently in beta.

If you want to use a Postgres database instead of CockroachDB you can [overwrite the default configuration](../configure/configure).

Postgres can be configured as follows:
```yaml
Database:
  postgres:
    Host: 
    Port:
    Database:
    MaxOpenConns:
    MaxConnLifetime:
    MaxConnIdleTime:
    Options:
    User:
      Username:
      Password:
      SSL:
        Mode:
        RootCert:
        Cert:
        Key:
    Admin:
      Username:
      Password:
      SSL:
        Mode:
        RootCert:
        Cert:
        Key:
```
